# Install system dependencies that might be needed by some Python packages
# (e.g., for Pillow, or other C-extension based libraries if you add them)
# For now, keeping it minimal. Add as needed.
# RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends gcc libpq-dev \
#     && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# The RAG pipeline initialization is handled by the @app.on_event("startup") in api.py
